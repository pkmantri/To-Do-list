# To-Do-list
A To-Do List is a simple task management tool that helps users organize and prioritize their daily activities. It allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks while keeping track of completed and pending tasks. A well-designed to-do list enhances productivity, improves time management, and ensures important tasks are not forgotten.
